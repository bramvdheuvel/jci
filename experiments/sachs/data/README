sachs-jci-noICAM.csv contains the result of preprocessing the raw data from the
Sachs et al. 2005 paper by the sachs_pool_noICAM.R script. For the input of
that script, we used a .csv file obtained by concatenating all the raw flow
cytometry data as distributed by Sachs et al. (2005).

This is the reference to the Sachs et al. (2005) paper:
